<h1>The Best Movies According to Kayla</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Tangled</h3>
<p>If I could do a top 10 movies, Disney would be king.<br />
And need we say more about Tangled? It's a classic comfort movie.<br />
</p>
<h3>Coco</h3>
<p>It might seem like a simple coming of age/lesson learned movie<br />
but it also includes an accurate portrayal of how music can help<br />
people with memory impairment.
</p>
<h3>The Sound of Music</h3>
<p>It's an interesting story told through music and beautiful visuals.<br />
Family friendly all the way through.
